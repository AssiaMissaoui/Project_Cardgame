# Project_Cardgame

This is the first project I created as an individual challenge!

**Python Card Game**

This game contains 3 files in which the basis of the card game was built. The skelleton is there yet files 'player.py' and 'game.py' need finalization.
So far a deck of 52 cards was created with colors, icons, values and the ability to fill the deck with 52 cards in total. 

_Installation_

To play the game you will need to be able to run main.py on the last python version available (preferably). 

_usage_

The cards that were distributed will be visible in the terminal.
